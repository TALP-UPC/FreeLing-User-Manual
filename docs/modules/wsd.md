# Word Sense Disambiguation Module 

This module performs word-sense-disambiguation on content words in given sentences. This module is to be used if word sense disambiguation (WSD) is desired. If no disambiguation (or basic most-frequent-sense disambiguation) is needed, the [senses module](senses.md) is a lighter and faster option.

The module is an implementation of UKB algorithm [\[AS09\]](../references.md). UKB relies on a semantic relation network (in this case, WN and XWN) to disambiguate the most likely senses for words in a text using PageRank algorithm. See [\[AS09\]](../references.md) for details on the algorithm.

The module expects the input words to have been annotated with a list of candidate senses by the [senses module](senses.md), and
will rank the candidate senses according to the PageRank for each sense. The rank value is also provided in the result. 
The top-ranked sense(s) can be selected as the most likely disambiguation for the word in that context 

The API of the class is the following:

```C++
class ukb {
  public:
    /// Constructor. Receives a configuration file for UKB
    ukb(const std::string &cfgfile);

    /// analyze given sentence.
    void analyze(sentence &s) const;

    /// analyze given sentences.
    void analyze(std::list<sentence> &ls) const;

    /// return analyzed copy of given sentence
    sentence analyze(const sentence &s) const;

    /// return analyzed copy of given sentences
    std::list<sentence> analyze(const std::list<sentence> &ls) const;
};
```

The constructor receives a file name where module configuration options are found. The contents of the configuration files are the following:

*   A section `<PageRankParameters>` specifying values for UKB stopping criteria. E.g.:

    ```XML
    <PageRankParameters>
    Epsilon 0.03
    MaxIterations 10 
    Damping 0.85
    </PageRankParameters>
    ```

    The `Epsilon` value controls the precision with with the end of PageRank iterations is decided.  
    `MaxIterations` controls the maximum number of PageRank iterations, even is no convergence is reached.  
    The `Damping` parameter is the standard parameter in PageRank algorithm.

*   A section `<RelationFile>` specifying the knowledge base required by the algorithm. This section must contain a single line with the path to a file containing a list of relations between senses.
    ```XML
    <RelationFile>
    ../common/xwn.dat
    </RelationFile>
    ```
    The path may be absolute, or relative to the position of the ukb module configuration file.

    Given file must contain the semantic relationship graph to load. It is a text filecontaining pairs of related senses (WN synsets in this case). Relations are neither labelled nor directed.

    An example of the content of this file is:
    ```
    00003431-v 14877585-n
    00003483-r 00104099-r
    00003483-r 00890351-a
    ```
