# Install from source on MacOS

This section assumes you already downloaded and uncompressed FreeLing sources in a folder of your choice.
If not, please read Section [Installing from source](installation-source.md) before continuing.

It also assumes you installed development tools and FreeLing dependencies. 
If not, please read Section [Install FreeLing Requirements on MacOS](requirements-mac.md)

Finally, it assumes you know where you want to install FreeLing (e.g. `/Users/myself/freeling`, `/Users/myself/programs/freeling`, etc.). You can omit this, and FreeLing will be installed in the default location `/usr/local`.
***IMPORTANT***: From this point on, we will refer to FreeLing installation folder (either chosen by you or the default location) as `$FLINSTALL`.

## Build FreeLing

* Open a terminal and change to the folder where you uncompressed or cloned the downloaded FreeLing source.

* Execute the commands:  
  ```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -DICU_ROOT=/usr/local/opt/icu4c
  make install
  ```
  This will install FreeLing in `/usr/local`.  
  
You can speed up compilation using several processors with, e.g.,  `make -j 4 install` (you can replace `4` with the number of processors you want to use).
  
To change the destination directory, add option `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$FLINSTALL` to the `cmake` command (where `$FLINSTALL` is the path where you want to install FreeLing).

Note that cmake does not create an "uninstall" target. So, if you install in `/usr/local`, you may need to selectively remove files when you want to uninstall FreeLing.

If you installed in a custom folder and want a clean re-install, you can delete folder `$FLINSTALL` (be careful if it is  `/usr/local`, there may be other software installed there), and run `make install` again from the `build` folder.

If you want a clean re-build, you can delete the `build` folder, and repeat the  whole procedure.

Available options that can be added to the `cmake` command:

| Option  | Effect  |
| :---    | :---    |
|`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>`| Install FreeLing in given location (default: `/usr/local`) |
|`-DTRACES=ON`      | Build FreeLing with debugging traces (default: `OFF`) |
|`-DWARNINGS=OFF`   | Build FreeLing without warning messages (default: `ON`)|
|`-DXPRESSIVE=ON`   |  Build FreeLing using boost::xpressive regexps instead of boost::regex (default: `OFF`) |
|`-DEMBEDDINGS=ON`  | Download word embeddings files when installing (default: `OFF`). Warning: Adds 2Gb to required installation space. |
| `-DJAVA_API=ON`   | Build Java API (default: `OFF`. See [Building and using APIs on MacOS](apis-mac.md) for details). |
|`-DPYTHON2_API=ON` | Build Python 2 API (default: `OFF`. See [Building and using APIs on MacOs](apis-mac.md) for details).|
|`-DPYTHON3_API=ON` | Build Python 3 API (default: `OFF`. See [Building and using APIs on MacOS](apis-mac.md) for details).|


## Test FreeLing
After installing, you are ready to use FreeLing. See sections [Test FreeLing Installation on Mac](test-mac.md), [Execute FreeLing demo](../analyzer.md) and [Call FreeLing Library](apis-mac.md) to find out more on how to use FreeLing.
