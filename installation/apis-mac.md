# Building and using APIs on Linux

If you don't want to write Python or Java programs that call Freeling, you can skip this section.

To be able to call FreeLing from Python or Java, you should have built it from source, using cmake options `-DPYTHON2_API`, `-DPYTHON3_API`, or `-DJAVA_API`, depending on your target.
If you haven't see [Install from source on Linux](installation-linux.md) to find out how to do so.

Next sections assume you compiled and installed FreeLing with the appropriate APIs for your target language.
***IMPORTANT***: From this point on, we will refer to FreeLing installation folder (either chosen by you or the default location) as `$FLINSTALL`.

## APIs Requirements

If you want to call FreeLing library from Python or Java, you need to install some extra software *before* building FreeLing:

1. **Install SWIG** 
   Available as a package in most distributions.  
   If not, you can download the source from  [http://swig.org](http://swig.org) and compile it.

2. Install target language, including interfaces, that is:

   * **For Python**: Install Python2 or Python3.
     Make sure you install also development headers (e.g. package python3-dev)
    
    FreeLing uses UTF8 encoding to support multilinguality. Python3 is native in UTF8, which provides a much smoother integration with FreeLing. You can use Python2, but if you have encoding problems, we told you so...
    
   * **For Java**: Install Java Development Kit. Make it includes JNI headers.

3. Add the following options to the "cmake" command during the procedure described in [Install from source on Linux](installation-linux.md)  
   `-DPYTHON2_API=ON`  \(if you want to build Python 2 API. Not compatible with `-DPYTHON3_API`\)  
   `-DPYTHON3_API=ON`  \(if you want to build Python 3 API. Not compatible with `-DPYTHON2_API`\)  
   `-DJAVA_API=ON`     \(if you want to build Java API\)


## PYTHON

If you built the Python2 (or Python3 API), you'll find in `$FLINSTALL/share/freeling/APIs/python2` (or `.../python3`) the following files:

| File | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `pyfreeling.py` | FreeLing python module, to be imported from your program.<br>It must be in the same folder than your program or in a folder included in `$PYTHONPATH`.|
| `_pyfreeling.so` | This file is the actual API DLL, bridging between Python and C++.<br>It must be in the same folder than your program, or in a folder included in `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. |
| `sample.py` | An example of a python program that calls FreeLing. |

To run the example, do:
```
   cd $FLINSTALL/share/freeling/APIs/python
   python sample.py < mytext.txt
```

* If you get "ImportError" about not found modules, you need to set `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so all the required libraries (freeling and all its dependencies) are found, as well as the `_pyfreeling.so` API library (you need to do this only once per session, or you can set it once and forever in your system-wide configuration):
  ```
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$FLINSTALL/lib;$FLINSTALL/share/freeling/APIs/python2
  ```

* If you get "FREELINGDIR not defined", you need to set the location where FreeLing was installed:
  ```
  set FREELINGDIR=$FLINSTALL
  ```
  (Note: this is because the example program "sample.py" checks that variable, it is not a general requirement of the API or FreeLing)


## JAVA

If you built the Java API, you'll find in `$FLINSTALL/share/freeling/APIs/java` the following files:

| File | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Jfreeling.jar | FreeLing Java module, to be imported from your program.<br>It must be included in `$CLASSPATH`. |
| libJfreeling.so | The actual API, bridging between Java and C++.<br>It must be in the same folder than your program or in a folder included in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` |
| Analyzer.java | An example of a Java program that calls FreeLing. |

To run the example, do:
```
   cd $FLINSTALL/share/freeling/APIs/java
   javac Analyzer.java
   java Analyzer < mytext.txt
```

* If you get "UnsatisfiedLinkError" about not found libraries, you need to set `$LS_LIBRARY_PATH` so all the required libraries (freeling and all its dependencies, as well as `libJfreeling.so`) are found (you need to do this only once per session, or you can set it once and forever in your system-wide configuration):
  ```
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$FLINSTALL/lib;$FLINSTALL/share/freeling/APIs/java
  ```

* If you get "FREELINGDIR not defined", you need to set the location where reeLing was installed:
  ```
     export FREELINGDIR=$FLINSTALL
  ```
  (Note: this is because the example program "Analyzer.java" checks that variable, it is not a general requirement of the API or FreeLing)

* If you get memory-related errors \(allocation error, array out of range, etc\), it may be that your JVM has not enough RAM for FreeLing.  Try with -Xmx1G or more.
